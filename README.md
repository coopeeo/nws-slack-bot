# NWS Slack Bot
todo: this thingy lmao

TODO:
- [ ] seperate into different channels per area so it doesn't get clogged up all in one channel
- [ ] add a debug channel when it gonna crash uh oh
- [ ] Make cancelations actually work
- [ ] send messages 1 by one and while yes it would be slower, then no rate limit, and no i'm not making two bots or even more to get around that
- [ ] Maybe make it so you can configure spcific areas and leave out others
- [ ] subscribe to certain citys or countys so NWS bot messages you when there is an alert in ur area
- [ ] better error catching so it doesn't crash
